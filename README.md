# Portfolio Website

## Description

The purpose of this project was to create a portfolio website that we can update as this course continues. It should include links to all of the projects that I have worked on as well as an about me section, a way to contact me, and a way to view my resume. Additionally we were tasked with formatting the CSS to allow a screen appropriate view of the webpage based on device that the user is using to view the site.

## Installation

Open the link in a browser.

## Usage

The website will display a brief about me, a section with links to all of my projects, and a way to contact me. Use the navigation bar at the top of the screen in order to go straight to where you need to go.
